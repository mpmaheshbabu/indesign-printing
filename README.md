# Indesign Printing
## InDesign templates and scripts created by the VIRAT Digipress prepress department 

As one of India's best digital print providers, we're used to automating as many tasks as possible. Over the years, we've built up a toolkit of InDesign scripts that have proved useful to us, and now we're going to start sharing them publicly on GitHub.
